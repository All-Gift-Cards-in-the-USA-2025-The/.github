## Are These Tools Safe?

Using tools from GitHub for free gems can be risky for several reasons:

1. **Account Ban Risks**: Brawl Stars' terms of service strictly prohibit unauthorized methods to gain gems. Supercell has anti-cheat measures to detect and ban accounts using such tools.  
2. **Malware and Viruses**: Unverified scripts from GitHub may contain harmful code that compromises your device's security.  
3. **Scams**: Some tools may redirect you to fake surveys or ask for personal information.

## How to Stay Safe?

1. **Verify the Repository**: Check if the GitHub repository is from a trusted developer. Look at the star count, reviews, and recent updates.  
2. **Avoid Personal Information Requests**: Legitimate tools never ask for your login credentials or sensitive information.  
3. **Test in a Sandbox Environment**: If you’re curious, run the code in a secure environment to test its behavior before linking it to your main account.  
4. **Backup Your Account**: Ensure your game progress is linked to Supercell ID to prevent permanent loss.
